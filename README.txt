Autor: Christoph Wagner

Software used for the project:
- Jupyter Notebook Server 6.0.3
- Python 3.8 (64 bit)

Libraries used in the project:
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- sklearn.linear_model
- sklearn.model_selection
- sklearn.metrics
- numpy

Motivation for the project:
In my project, I analyze the distribution of the preferred start of work hour of software developers (based on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey of 2017).
The aim of the project was to find correlations to other features of the dataset, e.g. employment status, nationality, salary and preferences in job search.
As I in my current job realized big differences between people concerning their working time preferences, I wanted to examine its distribution in different cultures and the impact on income.

- Addendum_LRModel.ipynb		Jupyter notebook with an additional application of Linear Models (as taught in the course lessons) on the dataset. For clarification of questions with teachers. 
- survey_results_public.csv		The analyzed dataset
